2. **Pinecone Account**: Sign up at [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
3. **Pinecone Index**: Create an index with dimension 1536 (for OpenAI embeddings)
4. **Knowledge Files**: Your Huawei certification materials in markdown format

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name_here

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Huawei Certification Assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Initialize Knowledge Base

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit the setup page: `http://localhost:3000/setup`

3. Click "Initialize Knowledge Base" to load your Huawei certification materials into Pinecone

### 4. Start Chatting

Once initialization is complete, visit `http://localhost:3000` to start using the chatbot!

## Knowledge Base Structure

Your knowledge files should be organized in the `knowledge/` directory like this:

```
knowledge/
â”œâ”€â”€ 5G/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HCIA-5G.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HCIP-5G-Core.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ datacom/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HCIA-Datacom.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HCIP-Datacom.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ cloud-computing/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HCIA-Cloud-Computing.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/knowledge` - Returns all knowledge chunks
- `POST /api/chat` - Handles chat messages and returns AI responses
- `POST /api/initialize` - Initializes the knowledge base in Pinecone

## Usage

1. **Ask Questions**: Type your questions about Huawei certifications
2. **Get Responses**: The AI will search your knowledge base and provide relevant answers
3. **Explore Topics**: Ask about specific technologies like 5G, datacom, cloud computing, etc.

## Example Questions

- "What is HCIA certification?"
- "Tell me about 5G core network architecture"
- "What are the prerequisites for HCIP Datacom?"
- "Explain Huawei cloud computing solutions"
- "What topics are covered in HCIA Security?"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No knowledge chunks found"**

   - Check that your markdown files are in the `knowledge/` directory
   - Ensure files have `.md` extension

2. **"Failed to initialize knowledge base"**

   - Verify your environment variables are set correctly
   - Check that your Pinecone index exists and is accessible
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid

3. **"Failed to process your request"**
   - Check that the knowledge base has been initialized
   - Verify your API keys are working

### Debug Steps

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify your `.env.local` file has all required variables
3. Ensure your Pinecone index has the correct dimension (1536)
4. Test your API keys independently
